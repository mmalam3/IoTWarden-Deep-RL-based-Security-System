# IoTWarden: A Deep Reinforcement Learning based Real-time Defense System to Mitigate Trigger-action IoT Attacks 
This repository contains the Python implementation of _IoTWarden_, a **Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)** based realtime defense system that helps a security agent in an IoT network take essential defense actions against an ongoing remote injection (trigger-action) attack. IoTWarden solves a **Markov Decision Process (MDP)** using **Deep Q-Network (DQN)**[1] to determine the optimal defense policy (sequence of actions) for the security agent.
